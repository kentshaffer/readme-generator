# Some Cool Project Title

## Awesome subtitle 

This is a very detailed description of what my app does. It’s really cool and solves a lot of problems. I worked really hard to make this concept become reality. I really hope you like my project and give it five thumbs up. That’s a quick description of what I built. Thank you.

## Areas Covered:

* Included a user-friendly nav bar with buttons that shade on hover and pop out when clicked
* Bio section lets the visitor get to know me as the developer
* Web app navigates between HTML pages flawlessly
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files have been commented for easy navigation and/or future development
* User inputs save information to local storage

## Deployed application: (https://reallycoolproject.devcreation.llll)

## Installation

Generic installation instructions: just press the install button and then wait for the progress bar to load. Installation should only take 3-5 days max

## Usage

Here are the usage instructions in case you can’t figure it out. This is my favorite app, so I hope you get to use it. Step 1. Instructions, step 2. Instructions, step 3. Instructions. All set!

## Credits

I made this all by myself, but if I had help, the names of the contributors would go here. We all worked as a team and navigated many hurdles to make it here today

## Continuing Development

I think it would be great if in the future the app could generate its own calendar on click of the submit button. It would also be really cool if you could set a timer while using the app. If you want to figure out how to add these features, here are the instructions I have so far

## Tests

I’m just learning about testing code, and honestly I’m lost so far, but if this was the readme for a professional project, the tests would go here
