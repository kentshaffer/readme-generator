## 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

Created a node.js driven readme generator that works from the command line. The question prompts are recorded using the Inquirer package. Answered questions populate a skeleton framework, which is then written into a readme.md file upon completion of the command line questions. Placeholder answers have been give to demonstrate functionality of the app for the screen recording. 

## Areas Covered:
* Node modules included in gitignore file so that the directory is not tracked or uploaded to GitHub.
* Dependencies installed to run inquirer.
* Variables created to plug inquirer responses into readme string template literal before the string literal is written into a readme file.
* Added readme sections as shown in the "Professional README Guide."
* Screen recorded demonstration of app functions.
