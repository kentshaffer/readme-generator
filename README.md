## 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

Created a node.js driven application that generates a readme.md file, operated from the command line. The applicatiopn includes all relevant question categories and sections to create a high quality readme. The question prompts are recorded using the Inquirer package. Answered questions populate a skeleton framework, which is then written into a readme.md file upon completion of the command line questions with fs.writeFile. Placeholder answers have been give to demonstrate functionality of the app for the screen recording.

## About the author:

My name is Kent Shaffer and I am a student in UCSD's full stack web development bootcamp. Prior to starting the program I had zero code experience, so it feels I've been drinking in new information through a fire hose, but I have been loving learning, and I'm excited about all the possibilities that live within the scope of the technologies I have been learning.

If you have any questions, or would like to get in contact, I can be reached at kentshaff@gmail.com
